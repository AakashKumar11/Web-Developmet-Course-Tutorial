    <!-- Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.
    1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
    2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match { the order of specificity is: Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector}
    3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a bowser extension, or your authored CSS
    4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type -->
